# tra-temptation
A mock website for a local boba shop that I made while my friend worked there. This site is solely for learning purposes!

The project allows users to add items to a cart for checkout, but I'm still currently working on implementing a payment system and making the display more accessible to mobile users by adding a dropdown menu.
